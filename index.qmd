ManyFaces is a developing international network of face researchers. The network was formed in early 2022, when 104 researchers contributed to a brainstorming session. There are currently about 200 members registered, from countries including India, Malaysia, Israel, Australia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Canada, USA, and many European countries.

We will set up a mechanism to formally join ManyFaces soon, but for now you can [register interest in joining](https://forms.gle/5CiiDT14RjHXTt886) on a Google form.
